# PyReproWeb <small>a _micro_ repository browser</small>

## Getting Started

### Requirements

This app was developed on Ubuntu 10.04 and required several python packages which are either not included in the base distribution, or are now out of date.

`3rdParty/python` contains several packages which are neccassary for the app to run.

1. [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/) - the web framework used to build the app.
1. [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/) - templating framework used to build the pages.
1. [wekzeug](http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/) - wsgi utility library used by flask.
1. [OrderedDict](http://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict) - 
   The ordered dictionary python type taken from python 2.7 .

### Repo Browser

### Package List/Sort/Search

## Upcoming

* Browse page layout improvement - more obvious links. 
	* Support for multiple distros
	* Support for specific queries on a distro. 
* JSON response on all endpoints.


## Later (maybe)

* Repository management. 
	* See repoman.sourceforge.net or packages.debian.org for examples of where this can go.
